                <h2> My childhood</h2>
                <p>
                    Starting fom the scratch I was born in the capital of 
                    Ethiopia(specifically in Tikur Anbessa Hospital) in
                    May 22 2000(in Gregorian calander). Then my family 
                    moved to Hawassa for living. Although I cannot remember
                    my childhod Hawwasa is my beloved city from my faded 
                    meomeries. After 6 years we moved back to Addis Ababa.
                    Then we started living in our current residence
                    (Asko in Gulele subcity).

            <h2> Education</h2>
            <p> I learned pre-school in Ascko Progress Acadamy.
                I finished primary school in Asko Progress Acadamy
                ( from grade 1 up to grade 6) and Lideta Catholic 
                Cathedral School( from grade 7 up to grade 8). 
                I finished secondary school in Lideta Catholic Catedral
                School. Most of my memories about my life are connected
                with my school life (specially in LCCS). 
                As every child in generation I always had diffrent answers
                when people asked me what I want to be when I grow up. 
                I didnot get the question untill I was grade 5 student.
                My answer was to be a Pilot in grade 7. In grade 9
                I wanted to be a desiner. In grade 12 I wanterd to join
                the medical school or be an arctect but none of this
                assumptions became true.
            </p>

            <h2> Youth</h2>
            <p> Now I am an engeneering student at ITSC center 
                of Addis Ababa Institute of Technology. My freshman year
                had a lot of ups and downs. The first semister was 
                exciting and easy as I was learning common course of pre 
                Engineering. Then on second semister I joined Software 
                Engineering Department.
                Then my life started getting boring becouse it was always
                about attending endless classes, doing assignments, studing for 
                tests and getting surprized by the results.
                My Second year's first semister was the best time of all
                becouse it was the time were I knew  I can be A software engineer,
                how to handle my works and workout on my schedules 
                and got to know my field more. <br>
                My hobbies are hiking, listning(anything), swimming,
                travelig etc... I prefer reading books over sport and
                watching movies over paying games. They are part of
                hobbies. And mostly I enjoy thinking about somthing 
                in a quite and dark place.
