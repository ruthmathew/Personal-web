                 The War of the Worlds
            </a>
            <p>
                The War of the Worlds, is a science fiction novel by H.G. Wells,
                first published serially by Pearson’s Magazine in the U.K. 
                and by The Cosmopolitan magazine in the U.S. in 1897. The 
                novel details a catastrophic conflict between humans and 
                extraterrestrial “Martians.” It is considered a landmark 
                work of science fiction, and it has inspired numerous 
                adaptations and imitations.

                The Thirty-Nine Steps
            </a>
            <p>
                The Thirty-Nine Steps was written by John Buchan and 
                published in the year 1915. The book was subsequently made
                into a film, with several different adaptations. The novel
                begins as Richard Hannay has just arrived back in London
                after an extensive stay in South Africa. Hannay is accustomed
                to a fast-paced lifestyle and quickly tires of the London 
                scene. Shortly after his return home, he meets a secret 
                agent who believes that Great Britain is on the verge of a 
                war with Germany and warns Hannay to be on the lookout for a 
                group of assassins, collectively known as The Black Stone.

                Lord of the Flies
            </a>
            <p>
                William Golding’s first novel Lord of the Flies is one of 
                the most-read works of contemporary fiction since the Second 
                World War. The author’s most popular fiction was written in 
                1954 and has been interpreted politically, religiously, 
                anthropologically and psychologically although the story 
                as such is quite simple. However, what makes the book 
                remarkable is how excessively Golding uses the setting in 
                order to get across the fable’s moral.

                 The Count of Monte Cristo
            </a>
            <p>
                The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) 
                is an adventure novel by French author Alexandre Dumas (père) 
                completed in 1844. The story takes place in France, Italy, 
                and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical 
                events of 1815–1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration 
                through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins 
                just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned 
                to power after his exile). The historical setting is a 
                fundamental element of the book, an adventure story 
                primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance,
                mercy, and forgiveness. It centres on a man who is wrongfully 
                imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets 
                about exacting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. His plans have devastating consequences for both the innocent and the guilty.
